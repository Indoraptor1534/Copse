# Copse
This is copse by me.Its a website  for people who want to use their laptop as a smart tv.It adds an extra layer of depth to the idea.
Download this then open the html(Copse code) file using your browser and click on the "+" sign to add and "-" sign to delete shortcuts,and the pen icon to chnage the background.Fullscreen should make the experience be more like using a smart TV
