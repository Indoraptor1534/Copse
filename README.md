This is copse by me.Its a website  for people who want to use their laptop as a smart tv.It adds an extra layer of depth to the idea.
downlaod this then open the html file and follow the comments(the ones in green) then open it with google(you can set it to open the site when google starts up or when your laptop starts up.
